# Class 7 - NER classification with BERT

Today we will be using HuggingFace's transformers library to implement a NER classification model using transformers.
We have discussed transfer learning in our lecture: today we will fine-tune a pretrained BERT model for NER.
We will also compare its performance and pipeline to the LSTM pipeline we implemented two weeks ago.
