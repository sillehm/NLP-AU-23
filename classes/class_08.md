# Class 8 - Getting started with text generation
- Today, we'll get started with the basics of text generation using HuggingFace transformers
- We will use HuggingFace pipelines to produce text, using different forms of decoding
- We will get a feel for how different forms of decoding affect the outputs
- We will look at instruction-based applications of language models, focusing specifically on text summarization, and comparing zero-shot the performance of a few models (e.g., T5) on this task
