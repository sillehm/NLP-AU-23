# Class 4 - Implementing gradient descent and a feed-forward neural network

Today we'll look into the basics of machine learning with Pytorch, focusing especially on two tasks:
- Implementing and understanding how to perform gradient descent using pytorch optimizer
- Creating a feed-forward NN for sentiment classification
