        "Today, we have looked into a few additional aspects of NLG:\n",
        "- **How to access very large models through `Petals`**. These large models often provide pretty good zero-shot performance, but it is not feasible to run them locally, and fine-tuning on local resources is pretty much impossible. Petals makes it possible to use them for inference, and to also perform some lightweight fine-tuning. Check out the documentation for some examples including fine-tuning of StableBeluga: https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals\n",
        "- **One- and few-shot inference**: With smaller and more manageable models, you can sometimes achieve good performance with good prompting and in-context learning. This can happen, for example, if the model has been trained on similar tasks, and it just requires some nudging to adapt its behavior to a new task/data;\n",
        "- **Instruction fine-tuning**: If in-context learning is not enough, you can fine-tune your model. Note that here we have fine-tuned a relatively small model, and scaling to larger models can become prohibitively resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource limitations are a serious concern when thinking of fine-tuning LLMs. But the development of methods that make it possible to efficiently fine-tune LLMs on reasonably-sized infrastructure is a very active area of research!\n",
        "\n",
        "In our last lecture of the course, I will mention a few methods that can help reduce the number of parameters we train in an efficient way, and in ways that do not significantly reduce performance (and that can easily be implemented through existing libraries). This class of methods is called PeFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning), and it includes methods like **quantization**, **LoRA**, and **prompt tuning**.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are curious about these methods, `Petals` example notebooks implement training with LoRA + quantization (QLoRa). You can also take a look at HuggingFace's PEFT library: https://github.com/huggingface/peft\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, if you really liked the intuition behind RLHF, you check out what is already available in the open-source ecosystem (e.g., https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx). This is a new, exciting, and fast-growing areas."
